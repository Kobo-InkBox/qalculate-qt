# Pre-compiled libraries for ARMv7
## Caution!
This should not be anyone's go-to solution when in search for pre-compiled libraries. Always try to seek the latest version of the libraries you want to use, and try to compile them for your platform before searching somewhere else (IMO).<br>These files have been linked against a prehistorical `glibc` **intentionally** (backward-compatibility with older kernels). Use at your own risk.
